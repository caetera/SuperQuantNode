# SuperQuantNode
##Description
Complementary Finder and MSn deconvolution processing nodes for Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.x.

##Compatability
The node is expected to be compatible with all versions of Proteome Discoverer startting from 2.0 and higher. It was tested on Proteome Discoverer 2.0.0.802 and 2.1.0.81. Earlier versions of Proteome Discoverer (for example 1.4) are not compatible with the node.
